        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            One of the favorite dishes from Indian Chinese cuisine is Chilli Paneer which is a vegetarian version of Chilli Chicken. 
            In a typical Chilli Paneer recipe, the fried paneer cubes are tossed in a sweet, sour, spicy sauce. The paneer cubes 
            can be coated with flours or batter coated and deep fried. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            The dry version of chilli paneer is served as a starter or appetizer snack. 
            The gravy version is had with steamed rice or noodles. The semi-dry version can be had as an appetizer.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To prepare the paneer, add paneer cubes, cornflour, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Toss to coat the paneer evenly with the cornflour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a tablespoon of oil in a frying pan on medium. Add the coated paneer cubes to the pan and fry until each side is golden brown and 
                crispy, turning constantly with a butter knife.
            </li>
            <li>
                To prepare the sauce, add soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, Sriracha and chilli powder to a bowl. Mix well and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a tablespoon of oil in a small wok on high. Add green cayenne chilli, ginger, garlic and onion. 
                Stir-fry for a minute or two until onion is glazed. Add the capsicum and spring onion. Stir-fry for another minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the prepared sauce. Mix well. Mix cornflour with the water and add to the wok. Add the paneer and mix well. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens and the paneer is heated through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat. Season with salt if required. Garnish with extra spring onion and serve hot with rice.
